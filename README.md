In this project, I analyse the public transport network in Budapest.
First, I create the public transport network from GTFS data.

Then I transform the network into a capacity-weighted directed graph, which allows me to examine the capacity surpluses and deficits based on existing traffic data.

I examine where bottlenecks in the network exist, then, assuming a modal shift, I add a part of the car traffic to the public transport traffic and analyze the effects of these 
modifications in network load.
